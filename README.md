# Travel Itenarary AI Agent
Minimize research and planning time by creating itineraries from scattered informations, streamlining routes and travel time.

### **Project Overview**
**Problem:** Travelers struggle to create itineraries because information is scattered, routes are inefficient, travel times are inaccurate, and research is time-consuming.

**Solution:** A Travel AI Agent that combines Gemini's reasoning capabilities with real-time geographic data from the Google Maps API to generate personalized, efficient, and ready-to-use itineraries in seconds.

### **Problem Statement**
Travel often feels overwhelming before it even begins because the planning process is time-consuming, confusing, and unstructured. Users must research tourist destinations one by one, compare distances, plan routes, consider duration, and ensure their itinerary is realistic and efficient. Many travelers — especially younger travelers on short trips (2–4 days) — complain that:

1. Destination information is scattered across multiple platforms
Users have to juggle between Google Maps, travel blogs, TikTok, Instagram, and other articles to understand what's interesting in an area.

2. It's difficult to assess whether the itinerary is realistic
Travel between locations is often not properly planned.

- Place A to Place B turns out to be far away
- Travel time takes longer than expected
- Schedules are too tight or too loose

3. Routes are often inefficient
Many travelers end up "going back and forth" or taking detours because they don't know the optimal order of destinations.

4. Limited time for research
Busy travelers (students, full-time workers) don't have 2–3 hours to put together a feasible itinerary.

5. High need for personalization
Generic recommendations are often inaccurate. Everyone has different preferences:
- nature tourism? culinary? museums? leisure activities?
- low budget vs. premium
- traveling alone, as a couple, or as a family

6. Lack of automatic integration between generative AI and real-world geographic data
Many AI-generated itineraries are still inaccurate because they don't consider:
- actual distance
- actual travel time
- geographical location
- fastest route
